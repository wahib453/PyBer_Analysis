# Overview of the Analysis 
## Purpose
1. >Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
2. >Use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
3. >Give a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


# Results

From the Pyber Summary DataFrame figure above, Rural city type has the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fares among the three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. It is five and thirteen times lower to suburban and urban respectively. General knowledge tells us that the population of the rural areas are always lower to suburban and urban areas. Thus confirming the values of the total rides, total drivers, and total fares. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is afew dollars more compare to the other two. This means that they pay alot more in fare per ride and fare per driver respectively. But this also doesn't mean that they are generating alot more revenue compare to the other two. Infact, the have the least revenue allocation because of their population. 

The multiple line charts below confirms to the results from the Pyber Summary DataFrame above. Moreover, the total fare dollar amount generated peak in certain months than the other months in all the city types. For example, in the urban areas, the fare price peak occurs around the following months: late February, early March, mid-March, and Early April. This could means that people tends to ride more during these periods than other periods. Thus generating more revenue than other months.

# Summary
Possible recommendations may include:
1. Divert alot more resources to areas with less access to rides
2. Encourage people to ride
3. Hire more drivers in areas with need for drivers. This can create job opportunity to unemployed.
